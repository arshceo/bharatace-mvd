# Event Registration Fix - Smart Registration Tool

## Problem

**User Request:**
```
User: "Register me for the seminar"
AI: Shows event list but DOESN'T actually register
```

**Logs showed:**
```
INFO: Intent Analysis: Register the student for the Career Guidance Seminar
INFO: Tool Calls: ['get_upcoming_events']  ← Only this, no register_for_event!
```

**Root Causes:**

1. **Multi-Step Reasoning Gap**: The AI agent's single-pass intent analysis couldn't handle:
   - Step 1: Get events → extract UUID
   - Step 2: Call register with that UUID

2. **Complex Tool Workflow**: The old `register_for_event` tool required:
   ```
   User says "register for seminar"
   → AI must call get_upcoming_events
   → AI must parse response to find "Career Guidance Seminar"
   → AI must extract the UUID field
   → AI must call register_for_event with UUID
   ```
   
3. **Agent Limitation**: The custom smart agent does one-time intent analysis, not iterative reasoning needed for multi-step tool chains.

## The Fix

### Created: `smart_register_for_event()` - One-Step Registration

**Location:** `backend/tools/events_tool.py`

**What it does:**
- Accepts EITHER event name OR event UUID
- Automatically handles the name → UUID conversion internally
- Registers the student in one tool call

**How it works:**

```python
def smart_register_for_event(student_id: str, event_identifier: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Smart event registration that handles both event names and UUIDs.
    
    1. Check if event_identifier is UUID → register directly
    2. If it's a name → search upcoming events → find match → extract UUID → register
    
    Supports partial matching:
    - "seminar" matches "Career Guidance Seminar"
    - "AI Workshop" matches "AI/ML Workshop"
    """
```

**Example Flow:**

```
User: "Register me for the seminar"

Before (FAILED):
├─ AI calls get_upcoming_events ✅
└─ AI should call register_for_event ❌ (never happened)

After (WORKS):
└─ AI calls smart_register_for_event(student_id, "seminar") ✅
   ├─ Tool checks: "seminar" is not UUID
   ├─ Tool calls get_upcoming_events internally
   ├─ Tool finds: "Career Guidance Seminar" matches "seminar"
   ├─ Tool extracts UUID: "7e355e64-9fd2-4fbf-867d-038728018a64"
   └─ Tool calls register_for_event(student_id, UUID) → SUCCESS!
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Smart Registration Function

**File:** `backend/tools/events_tool.py` (added at end, line ~474)

```python
def smart_register_for_event(student_id: str, event_identifier: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Smart registration that accepts name OR UUID.
    
    Features:
    - UUID detection (tries to parse as UUID)
    - Name matching (case-insensitive, partial match)
    - Multiple match detection (asks user to be specific)
    - Event not found suggestions (lists available events)
    """
    try:
        # Try to parse as UUID
        try:
            uuid.UUID(event_identifier)
            return register_for_event(student_id, event_identifier)
        except ValueError:
            pass  # It's a name, not UUID
        
        # Get upcoming events
        upcoming = get_upcoming_events()
        
        # Find matching event
        event_identifier_lower = event_identifier.lower()
        matching_events = [
            e for e in upcoming['events']
            if event_identifier_lower in e.get('title', '').lower()
            or e.get('title', '').lower() in event_identifier_lower
        ]
        
        if len(matching_events) == 0:
            return {"success": False, "message": "No matching event found"}
        
        if len(matching_events) > 1:
            return {"success": False, "message": f"Multiple matches: {titles}"}
        
        # Exactly one match - register!
        event = matching_events[0]
        result = register_for_event(student_id, event['id'])
        result['event_title'] = event['title']
        
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

### 2. Updated Tool Import

**File:** `backend/main.py` (line ~80)

```python
from tools.events_tool import (
    get_upcoming_events,
    get_event_details,
    register_for_event,
    smart_register_for_event,  # NEW!
    get_student_events,
    search_events
)
```

### 3. Replaced Tool Registration

**File:** `backend/main.py` (line ~304)

**Before:**
```python
register_event_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(
    fn=register_for_event,
    description="Requires event_id as UUID. Must call get_upcoming_events first..."
)
```

**After:**
```python
register_event_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(
    fn=smart_register_for_event,
    name="register_for_event",
    description="""Register a student for an event using EITHER event name OR UUID.
    
    SMART tool that handles both:
    - Event names: "Career Guidance Seminar", "AI Workshop"
    - Event UUIDs: "7e355e64-9fd2-4fbf-867d-038728018a64"
    - Partial matches: "seminar" matches "Career Guidance Seminar"
    
    Parameters:
    - student_id: Student's UUID
    - event_identifier: Event name OR UUID
    
    Examples:
    - register_for_event(student_id, "Career Guidance Seminar")
    - register_for_event(student_id, "seminar")  # Works!
    """
)
```

### 4. Updated AI Examples

**File:** `backend/smart_agent.py` (line ~132)

**Before:**
```python
Event Registration (REQUIRES 2 STEPS):
- "Register me for seminar" -> STEP 1: get_upcoming_events, STEP 2: register_for_event
```

**After:**
```python
Event Registration (SIMPLE - ONE STEP):
- "Register me for seminar" -> Use register_for_event(student_id, event_identifier="seminar")
- "Sign me up for Career Guidance Seminar" -> register_for_event(student_id, "Career Guidance Seminar")
- Note: event_identifier can be name OR UUID - tool handles both!
```

## Features of Smart Registration

### ✅ Accepts Multiple Formats

```python
# All of these work:
smart_register_for_event(student_id, "Career Guidance Seminar")  # Full name
smart_register_for_event(student_id, "seminar")  # Partial match
smart_register_for_event(student_id, "SEMINAR")  # Case-insensitive
smart_register_for_event(student_id, "7e355e64-...")  # Direct UUID
```

### ✅ Intelligent Matching

```python
# Partial matching:
"seminar" → finds "Career Guidance Seminar" ✅
"AI" → finds "AI/ML Workshop" ✅
"hackathon" → finds "Tech Hackathon 2025" ✅
```

### ✅ Error Handling

```python
# No match:
"python course" → "No event found. Available: Career Guidance Seminar, AI Workshop, ..."

# Multiple matches:
"workshop" → "Multiple events match: AI Workshop, Design Workshop. Be more specific."

# Already registered:
"seminar" → "You are already registered for Career Guidance Seminar"

# Event full:
"seminar" → "Event is full"
```

### ✅ Smart Responses

```python
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "✅ Successfully registered for 'Career Guidance Seminar'!",
    "event_title": "Career Guidance Seminar",
    "event_date": "2025-10-15T14:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Simple Registration
```
User: "Register me for the seminar"
Expected: ✅ Successfully registered for 'Career Guidance Seminar'!
```

### Test Case 2: Partial Name
```
User: "Sign me up for AI"
Expected: ✅ Successfully registered for 'AI/ML Workshop'!
```

### Test Case 3: Full Name
```
User: "Register me for Career Guidance Seminar"
Expected: ✅ Successfully registered for 'Career Guidance Seminar'!
```

### Test Case 4: Check Registration
```
User: "What events am I registered for?"
Expected: Shows "Career Guidance Seminar" in the list
```

### Test Case 5: Already Registered
```
User: "Register me for seminar again"
Expected: "You are already registered for 'Career Guidance Seminar'"
```

## Verification in Logs

Look for:
```
INFO: Intent Analysis: Register the student for the seminar
INFO: Tool Calls: ['register_for_event']  ← Now uses smart version!
INFO: Found matching event: 'Career Guidance Seminar' (ID: 7e355e64-...)
INFO: Tool executed: register_for_event -> {'success': True, 'message': '✅ Successfully registered...
```

## Database Verification

```sql
-- Check event_participation table
SELECT 
    ep.id,
    ep.student_id,
    ep.event_id,
    ep.registration_date,
    ep.attendance_status,
    e.title AS event_title
FROM event_participation ep
JOIN events e ON ep.event_id = e.id
WHERE ep.student_id = 'c7e01df4-f843-4ad1-84cf-31def8e3385a';
```

Should return:
```
| id | student_id | event_id | registration_date | attendance_status | event_title |
|----|------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| ... | c7e01df4... | 7e355e64... | 2025-10-06... | registered | Career Guidance Seminar |
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Complex)
```
User Query
  ↓
Intent Analysis (single pass)
  ↓
get_upcoming_events ✅
  ↓
AI tries to call register_for_event ❌ (never happens - single pass!)
  ↓
Response: "Here are the events" (but no registration)
```

### After (Simple)
```
User Query
  ↓
Intent Analysis
  ↓
smart_register_for_event ✅ (handles everything internally)
  ├─ Finds event by name
  ├─ Gets UUID
  ├─ Registers student
  └─ Returns success
  ↓
Response: "✅ Successfully registered!"
```
