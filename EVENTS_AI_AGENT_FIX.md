# Events Query Not Working - AI Agent Fix

## Problem

**User Experience:**
```
User: "any workshops around"
AI: "I don't have specific information about workshops right now..."
```

**Logs Show:**
```
INFO:smart_agent:🧠 Intent Analysis: Find upcoming workshops.
INFO:main:✅ AGENT RESPONSE GENERATED
```

**Issue:** AI understands intent but doesn't call `get_upcoming_events` tool!

## Root Cause Analysis

### The AI Decision Flow

1. **User asks:** "any workshops around"
2. **AI analyzes intent:** "Find upcoming workshops" ✅
3. **AI decides:** `requires_tools = false` ❌ WRONG!
4. **Result:** No tool executed, no data retrieved

### Why AI Didn't Call the Tool

The intent analysis prompt only had examples for:
- Student-specific queries (attendance, marks, fees)
- General knowledge queries (courses, programs)

**Missing:** Examples for events/workshops queries!

The AI didn't know that event queries need the `get_upcoming_events` tool.

## The Fix

### Change 1: Updated Intent Analysis Examples

**File:** `backend/smart_agent.py`

**Added explicit examples for events:**

```python
Important: 
- If the query is about the student's personal data (attendance, marks, fees, timetable, library), 
  set requires_tools=true and include appropriate tool calls with the student's ID.
- If the query is about events or workshops, set requires_tools=true and use get_upcoming_events tool 
  (NO student_id needed)

Examples:
Student-Specific (need student_id):
- "What's my attendance?" -> Use get_student_attendance tool
- "Show my marks" -> Use get_student_marks tool  

Public Queries (NO student_id):
- "Any events around?" -> Use get_upcoming_events tool
- "Show me workshops" -> Use get_upcoming_events with event_type="workshop"
- "AI hackathons?" -> Use search_events with query="AI hackathon"

General Knowledge:
- "Tell me about courses" -> Use RAG only
```

### Change 2: Better Tool Documentation

**File:** `backend/tools/events_tool.py`

**Improved function docstring:**

```python
def get_upcoming_events(days_ahead: int = 30, event_type: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get upcoming college events, workshops, hackathons, seminars, etc.
    This is a PUBLIC tool - does NOT require student_id.
    
    Use this for queries like:
    - "Any events around?"
    - "Show me workshops"
    - "Upcoming hackathons?"
    - "What events are happening this week?"
    
    Args:
        days_ahead: Number of days to look ahead (default 30)
        event_type: Optional filter - use "workshop", "seminar", "hackathon", "cultural", "sports", "technical"
    """
```

### Change 3: Enhanced Logging

**Added detailed logging to see AI decisions:**

```python
logger.info(f"🧠 Intent Analysis: {intent_analysis['intent']}")
logger.info(f"🔧 Requires Tools: {intent_analysis.get('requires_tools', False)}")
logger.info(f"📚 Requires RAG: {intent_analysis.get('requires_rag', True)}")
if intent_analysis.get('tool_calls'):
    logger.info(f"🛠️  Tool Calls: {[tc.get('tool') for tc in intent_analysis['tool_calls']]}")
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test Case 1: General Events Query
```
User: "any events around"

Logs:
🧠 Intent Analysis: Find upcoming events
🔧 Requires Tools: True  ← Now true!
🛠️  Tool Calls: ['get_upcoming_events']  ← Tool called!

AI Response:
"Here are the upcoming events:
1. AI Workshop - October 15, 2025
2. Coding Hackathon - October 20, 2025
..."
```

### Test Case 2: Specific Event Type
```
User: "any workshops around"

Logs:
🧠 Intent Analysis: Find upcoming workshops
🔧 Requires Tools: True
🛠️  Tool Calls: ['get_upcoming_events']
(with params: event_type="workshop")

AI Response:
"Here are the upcoming workshops:
1. Python Workshop - October 18, 2025
..."
```

### Test Case 3: Follow-up Context
```
User: "any events around"
AI: [Lists events]

User: "any programming events"

Logs:
💬 Conversation history: 3 messages
🧠 Intent Analysis: Filter events for programming-related
🔧 Requires Tools: True
🛠️  Tool Calls: ['search_events']
(with query="programming")
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/smart_agent.py`
   - Added events examples to intent analysis prompt
   - Enhanced logging for debugging AI decisions

2. ✅ `backend/tools/events_tool.py`
   - Improved `get_upcoming_events()` docstring
   - Added usage examples
   - Clarified it's a PUBLIC tool (no student_id needed)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Basic events query**
  - Ask: "any events around"
  - Check logs: `Requires Tools: True`
  - Verify: AI lists actual events

- [ ] **Workshops query**
  - Ask: "any workshops"
  - Check logs: Tool calls with event_type="workshop"
  - Verify: AI shows workshops only

- [ ] **Hackathons query**
  - Ask: "upcoming hackathons"
  - Verify: AI shows hackathon events

- [ ] **Follow-up questions**
  - Ask: "any events"
  - Follow-up: "which ones are about AI"
  - Verify: AI uses conversation context

## Debug Information

### New Log Format
```
INFO:main:❓ QUESTION RECEIVED: any workshops around
INFO:main:💬 Conversation history: 1 messages
INFO:smart_agent:🧠 Intent Analysis: Find upcoming workshops
INFO:smart_agent:🔧 Requires Tools: True      ← Check this
INFO:smart_agent:📚 Requires RAG: False
INFO:smart_agent:🛠️  Tool Calls: ['get_upcoming_events']  ← Check this
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: GET .../events?...   ← API called
INFO:smart_agent:🔧 Tool executed: get_upcoming_events -> {...}
```

### What to Look For

**If still not working:**
1. Check: `Requires Tools:` should be `True`
2. Check: `Tool Calls:` should show `['get_upcoming_events']`
3. If both false → AI still not recognizing pattern
4. If true but no HTTP request → Tool execution failing

## Technical Details

### AI Learning Pattern

The AI uses the examples in the prompt to learn what queries need what tools:

**Pattern Matching:**
- "any events" → matches → "Any events around?" example → use get_upcoming_events
- "workshops" → matches → "Show me workshops" example → use get_upcoming_events with filter
- "hackathon" → matches → "AI hackathons?" example → use search_events

### Tool Selection Logic

1. **Parse query** → extract keywords
2. **Match examples** → find similar query pattern
3. **Set flags** → `requires_tools=true` if match found
4. **Generate tool_calls** → with appropriate parameters
5. **Execute tools** → call functions and get data
6. **Synthesize response** → combine tool results with natural language

## Summary

**Problem:** AI not calling events tool for queries like "any workshops around"  
**Cause:** No examples in AI prompt showing events queries need tools  
**Solution:** Added explicit events examples to intent analysis prompt  
**Bonus:** Improved logging to debug AI decisions  
**Result:** Events queries should now work correctly ✅
