# 🧪 Quick Test Guide - RAG Pipeline Fix

## Test the Fixed RAG Pipeline

### ✅ Backend Status Check

The backend is now running with **11 documents indexed**:

```
✅ VectorStoreIndex built successfully with 11 documents!
✨ Documents are now embedded and searchable!
🎯 Ready to answer questions!
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Tests to Run

### Test 1: Open Chatbot

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3000
2. **You should see:** Welcome message from AI
3. **Server status:** Green "Online" indicator

### Test 2: Ask About Library

**Type this question:**
```
What are the library hours?
```

**Expected Backend Logs:**
```
❓ QUESTION RECEIVED: What are the library hours?
🔍 STEP 1: Retrieving relevant documents...
📊 RETRIEVED 5 DOCUMENTS:
   📄 DOCUMENT 1:
      🎯 Similarity Score: 0.85+
      📁 Category: Library
      📝 Content Preview: The library is open from 8:00 AM...
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
The library is open from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, 
and from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on weekends.
```

### Test 3: Ask About Admissions

**Type this question:**
```
How do I apply for admissions?
```

**Expected Backend Logs:**
```
📊 RETRIEVED 5 DOCUMENTS:
   📄 DOCUMENT 1:
      🎯 Similarity Score: 0.78+
      📁 Category: Admissions
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
Information about the admissions process including application 
steps and requirements.
```

### Test 4: Ask About Fees

**Type this question:**
```
How can I pay my fees?
```

**Expected Backend Logs:**
```
📊 RETRIEVED 5 DOCUMENTS:
   📄 DOCUMENT 1:
      🎯 Similarity Score: 0.82+
      📁 Category: Fee Payment
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
Details about fee payment methods and procedures.

## 🔍 How to Read Backend Logs

### Look for These Patterns

✅ **Good Retrieval (Working):**
```
📊 RETRIEVED 5 DOCUMENTS:
   📄 DOCUMENT 1:
      🎯 Similarity Score: 0.75-0.95  ← High score = relevant!
      📁 Category: Library              ← Correct category
```

❌ **Bad Retrieval (Would indicate problem):**
```
📊 RETRIEVED 0 DOCUMENTS:
⚠️  WARNING: NO DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED!
```

### Similarity Score Guide

- **0.85 - 1.00:** Excellent match - highly relevant
- **0.70 - 0.84:** Good match - relevant
- **0.50 - 0.69:** Moderate match - somewhat relevant
- **Below 0.50:** Poor match - may not be relevant

## 🎨 What Each Test Proves

| Test | What It Proves |
|------|---------------|
| **Library Hours** | ✅ Vector search working<br>✅ Embeddings generated correctly<br>✅ Retrieval returns relevant docs |
| **Admissions** | ✅ Different category retrieval working<br>✅ Semantic search functional |
| **Fees** | ✅ Multiple document types searchable<br>✅ RAG pipeline end-to-end working |

## 📊 Current Knowledge Base

The system has **11 documents** covering:

1. **Admissions** - Application process
2. **Fee Payment** - Payment methods
3. **Scholarships** - Available scholarships
4. **Exam Schedule** - Exam dates and times
5. **Re-evaluation Policy** - Grade re-evaluation
6. **CSE Department** - Computer Science info
7. **Library** - Library hours and services
8. **Library Fines** - Late fee policy
9. **Sports Facilities** - Sports amenities
10. **Tech Fest** - Annual tech festival
11. **Student Clubs** - Available clubs

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: No documents retrieved

**Check:**
1. Is backend running? (Check http://localhost:8000)
2. Did initialization complete? (Look for "✅ LLAMAINDEX INITIALIZATION COMPLETE!")
3. Are there 11 documents? (Look for "📊 Total Documents Indexed: 11")

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Restart backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Problem: Generic "I don't know" answers

**This means:** Documents aren't matching the query

**Check backend logs for:**
```
📊 RETRIEVED 0 DOCUMENTS:
⚠️  WARNING: NO DOCUMENTS RETRIEVED!
```

**Solution:** Try rephrasing your question to match document content

### Problem: Similarity scores below 0.50

**This means:** Query doesn't match any documents well

**Try:**
- More specific questions
- Use keywords from the knowledge base
- Check if topic exists in the 11 documents

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. ✅ **Startup logs show:**
   ```
   ✅ VectorStoreIndex built successfully with 11 documents!
   ✨ Documents are now embedded and searchable!
   ```

2. ✅ **Query logs show:**
   ```
   📊 RETRIEVED 5 DOCUMENTS:
   🎯 Similarity Score: 0.75+
   ```

3. ✅ **AI responses are:**
   - Relevant to your question
   - Include specific details
   - Reference document content

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Add More Knowledge (Optional)

1. **Open CMS:** http://localhost:3001
2. **Login:** Password = `BharatAceAdmin@2025`
3. **Add knowledge:**
   - Category: "Cafeteria"
   - Content: "The cafeteria is open from 7 AM to 9 PM..."
4. **Test in chatbot:**
   - Ask: "When does the cafeteria open?"
   - Should get relevant answer!

### Monitor Performance

Watch backend logs to see:
- How many documents are retrieved
- Similarity scores
- Response quality
- Processing time

## 📚 Example Questions to Try

### High-Confidence Questions (Should work perfectly)
```
1. What are the library hours?
2. How do I pay my fees?
3. What scholarships are available?
4. When are the exams?
5. What clubs can I join?
```

### Medium-Confidence Questions (Should work well)
```
1. Tell me about the computer science department
2. What sports facilities are available?
3. How do I apply for admission?
4. What happens if I return a book late?
5. When is the tech fest?
```

### Low-Confidence Questions (May not work - not in knowledge base)
```
1. What is the weather like?
2. Who is the vice chancellor?
3. Where can I park my car?
```
