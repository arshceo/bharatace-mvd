# Fee Payment History Fix

## Problem

**User Query:**
```
User: "When did I pay my fees?"
AI: "I can see your fee history for Semester 5, but I don't have the specific dates 
     of your payments. To find that information, check your student portal..."
```

**Issue:** AI couldn't show payment transaction history even though the data exists in `fee_transactions` table.

## Root Cause

The `get_fee_history()` function exists in `backend/tools/fees_tool.py` and was imported in `backend/main.py`, BUT it was **NOT registered as a tool** for the AI agent to use.

### What Was Missing

```python
# Function imported ‚úÖ
from tools.fees_tool import (
    get_student_fee_status,
    check_fee_clearance,
    get_fee_history,  # ‚Üê Imported but not used!
    calculate_late_fee
)

# Tool NOT created ‚ùå
# No FunctionTool.from_defaults for get_fee_history

# Tool NOT added to agent ‚ùå
tools = [
    fees_tool,
    fee_clearance_tool,
    # Missing: fee_history_tool
    timetable_tool,
    ...
]
```

## The Fix

### Change 1: Created Fee History Tool

**File:** `backend/main.py`

Added tool registration:
```python
fee_history_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(
    fn=get_fee_history,
    name="get_fee_history",
    description="Get complete payment transaction history for a student with dates, amounts, and payment methods. Use this when student asks 'when did I pay?' or 'show my payment history'. Requires student_id."
)
```

### Change 2: Added Tool to Agent

```python
tools = [
    knowledge_search_tool,
    attendance_tool,
    attendance_shortage_tool,
    marks_tool,
    cgpa_tool,
    rank_tool,
    fees_tool,
    fee_clearance_tool,
    fee_history_tool,  # ‚Üê Added!
    timetable_tool,
    next_class_tool,
    search_books_tool,
    student_loans_tool,
    reserve_book_tool,
    upcoming_events_tool,
    register_event_tool,
    student_events_tool
]
```

### Change 3: Updated AI Examples

**File:** `backend/smart_agent.py`

Added examples for fee history queries:
```python
Examples:
Student-Specific (need student_id):
- "What are my pending fees?" -> Use get_student_fee_status tool
- "When did I pay my fees?" -> Use get_fee_history tool       ‚Üê New!
- "Show my payment history" -> Use get_fee_history tool        ‚Üê New!
```

### Change 4: Updated Tool Count

```python
logger.info("‚úÖ Wrapped 18 AI tools successfully")  # Was 17
```

## What the Tool Returns

The `get_fee_history` function queries the `fee_transactions` table and returns:

```python
{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "amount": 25000.00,
            "payment_method": "upi",
            "transaction_id": "TXN12345",
            "transaction_date": "2025-09-15T10:30:00+00:00",
            "payment_status": "success",
            "fees": {
                "semester": 5,
                "academic_year": "2024-2025",
                "total_amount": 50000.00
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "amount": 23000.00,
            "payment_method": "netbanking",
            "transaction_id": "TXN67890",
            "transaction_date": "2025-08-10T14:20:00+00:00",
            "payment_status": "success",
            "fees": {
                "semester": 5,
                "academic_year": "2024-2025",
                "total_amount": 50000.00
            }
        }
    ],
    "total_paid": 48000.00,
    "transaction_count": 2,
    "success": true
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test Case 1: Basic Fee History Query
```
User: "When did I pay my fees?"

AI Response:
"Here's your fee payment history for Semester 5:

Payment 1:
- Date: September 15, 2025 at 10:30 AM
- Amount: ‚Çπ25,000
- Method: UPI
- Transaction ID: TXN12345
- Status: Success

Payment 2:
- Date: August 10, 2025 at 2:20 PM
- Amount: ‚Çπ23,000
- Method: Net Banking
- Transaction ID: TXN67890
- Status: Success

Total Paid: ‚Çπ48,000 out of ‚Çπ50,000
Balance Due: ‚Çπ2,000"
```

### Test Case 2: Payment History Request
```
User: "Show my payment history"

AI: Shows all transactions with dates, amounts, and methods
```

### Test Case 3: Specific Payment Date
```
User: "My fee history"
AI: Shows fee status

User: "When exactly did I make the payments?"
AI: Uses conversation context + fee_history tool to show detailed dates
```

## Technical Details

### Database Query

The tool executes this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    fee_transactions.*,
    fees.semester,
    fees.academic_year,
    fees.total_amount
FROM fee_transactions
JOIN fees ON fee_transactions.fee_id = fees.id
WHERE fee_transactions.student_id = ?
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Tool Metadata

- **Name:** `get_fee_history`
- **Input:** `student_id` (required), `limit` (optional, default 10)
- **Output:** Transaction list with dates, amounts, methods
- **Use Cases:** 
  - "When did I pay?"
  - "Show payment history"
  - "What payment methods did I use?"
  - "Transaction dates for my fees"

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `backend/main.py`
   - Created `fee_history_tool`
   - Added to tools list
   - Updated tool count to 18

2. ‚úÖ `backend/smart_agent.py`
   - Added fee history examples to intent analysis

## Testing

### Test Queries

1. **"When did I pay my fees?"**
   - Expected: Shows payment dates and amounts

2. **"Show my payment history"**
   - Expected: Complete transaction list

3. **"What payment methods did I use?"**
   - Expected: Lists payment methods from transactions

4. **"When was my last payment?"**
   - Expected: Shows most recent transaction

### Verification in Logs

Look for:
```
INFO:smart_agent:üß† Intent Analysis: Get payment history
INFO:smart_agent:üîß Requires Tools: True
INFO:smart_agent:üõ†Ô∏è  Tool Calls: ['get_fee_history']
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: GET .../fee_transactions?...
INFO:tools.fees_tool:Retrieved 2 payment transactions for student...
```

## Summary

**Problem:** AI couldn't show payment dates even though data exists  
**Cause:** Fee history function not registered as AI tool  
**Solution:** Created and registered `fee_history_tool`  
**Result:** AI can now show complete payment history with dates ‚úÖ  

**Tool Count:** 17 ‚Üí 18 tools  
**New Queries Supported:**
- "When did I pay my fees?"
- "Show my payment history"
- "What were the payment dates?"
- "How did I pay?" (payment methods)
