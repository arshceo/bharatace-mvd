# Chat UX Improvements - Three Bug Fixes

## Issues Reported by User

### Issue 1: Events Tool Error ❌
**Problem:**
```
User: "any events regarding ai or computers"
Error: get_upcoming_events() got an unexpected keyword argument 'student_id'
AI: "I don't have access to a tool that can find events"
```

**Root Cause:**
- AI agent was told to "use student_id for all tools"
- `get_upcoming_events()` is a PUBLIC tool - doesn't need student_id
- AI tried to pass student_id anyway, causing error

**Fix Applied:**
Updated instructions in `backend/main.py` to be more specific:
```python
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
...
4. For student-specific queries (attendance, marks, fees, timetable, library), use the student's ID
5. For general queries (events, knowledge), DO NOT pass student_id - these tools don't require it
```

### Issue 2: Repetitive Greetings 😫
**Problem:**
```
Every message: "Hey Priya, [answer]"
User said: "don't say hey and the name for each message only say it when required"
```

**Root Cause:**
Synthesis prompt in `backend/smart_agent.py` instructed AI to "Use the student's name when appropriate" - AI interpreted this as "every time".

**Fix Applied:**
Updated synthesis prompt to be explicit:
```python
Instructions:
1. Provide a helpful, conversational response
2. DO NOT start with greetings like "Hey [name]" or "Hello [name]" - get straight to the answer
3. Only use the student's name if it's contextually necessary
4. Be specific and actionable with data from tools
...
8. Focus on answering the question, not pleasantries
```

### Issue 3: Annoying Auto-scroll 📜
**Problem:**
```
User: "everytime i ask a query and press enter the whole page scrolls down it should not happen no auto scrolling"
```

**What Was Happening:**
Chat scrolled to bottom on EVERY message change, including when user typed and hit Enter.

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// BEFORE - Scrolls on ANY message change
useEffect(() => {
  scrollToBottom();
}, [messages]);
```

**Fix Applied:**
Only scroll when AI responds, not when user sends message:
```typescript
// AFTER - Only scrolls when AI responds
useEffect(() => {
  if (messages.length > 0 && !loading) {
    const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
    if (lastMessage.role === 'assistant') {
      scrollToBottom();
    }
  }
}, [messages, loading]);
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/main.py`
**Change:** Better instructions for when to use student_id
```python
# Line ~612
4. For student-specific queries (attendance, marks, fees, timetable, library), use the student's ID: {user.student_id}
5. For general queries (events, knowledge), DO NOT pass student_id - these tools don't require it
```

### 2. `backend/smart_agent.py`
**Change:** Don't repeat greetings
```python
# Line ~215 (synthesis_prompt)
2. DO NOT start with greetings like "Hey [name]" or "Hello [name]" - get straight to the answer
3. Only use the student's name if it's contextually necessary
```

### 3. `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ChatInterface.tsx`
**Change:** Smart auto-scroll (only on AI responses)
```typescript
// Line ~28
useEffect(() => {
  if (messages.length > 0 && !loading) {
    const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
    if (lastMessage.role === 'assistant') {
      scrollToBottom();
    }
  }
}, [messages, loading]);
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ Events Query
```
You: "any events regarding ai or computers"
AI: "Here are the upcoming events related to AI and computers:
     1. AI Workshop - Nov 15, 2025
     2. Coding Hackathon - Nov 20, 2025
     ..."
```
**No errors, no "I don't have access"**

### ✅ No Repeated Greetings
```
You: "What's my attendance?"
AI: "Your attendance is 85% (34/40 classes)"

You: "how many more to reach 90?"
AI: "You need to attend 6 more consecutive classes to reach 90%"
```
**No "Hey Priya" in the second response**

### ✅ No Auto-scroll on User Input
```
[User types message and hits Enter]
→ Input clears
→ User message appears
→ NO SCROLL (stays at current position)

[AI responds]
→ AI message appears
→ SCROLLS to show AI response ✅
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Test Events Query**
  - Ask: "any events about AI"
  - Verify: No errors, shows real events
  
- [ ] **Test No Repeated Greetings**
  - Ask first question
  - Ask follow-up
  - Verify: Second response doesn't start with "Hey [name]"
  
- [ ] **Test Auto-scroll**
  - Type a message
  - Press Enter
  - Verify: Chat doesn't scroll immediately
  - Wait for AI response
  - Verify: Chat scrolls to show AI message

## Technical Details

### Tool Categories

**Student-Specific Tools** (need student_id):
- `get_student_attendance`
- `get_student_marks`
- `get_student_fees`
- `get_student_timetable`
- `get_student_library_books`

**Public Tools** (no student_id needed):
- `get_upcoming_events` ← Fixed
- `register_for_event`
- `search_general_knowledge`
- `search_knowledge_by_category`

### Scroll Behavior

**Old:** Scroll on any `messages` change
**New:** Scroll only when:
1. Messages array has content
2. Not currently loading
3. Last message is from assistant

**Result:** User's input doesn't trigger scroll, only AI responses do.

## Summary

✅ **Issue 1 Fixed:** Events tool now works - AI won't pass student_id to public tools  
✅ **Issue 2 Fixed:** AI won't say "Hey [name]" in every message  
✅ **Issue 3 Fixed:** Chat only scrolls when AI responds, not when user types  

**Files Changed:** 3  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**Testing:** Manual conversation testing required
