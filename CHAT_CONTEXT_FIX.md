# Chat Context Fix - Conversation Memory

## Problem
The AI chat assistant was treating every message as a new conversation, not remembering previous messages in the session. This made follow-up questions impossible.

**Example of the Issue:**
```
User: "What's my attendance?"
AI: "Your attendance is 85%"
User: "How many more classes to reach 90%?"
AI: "What subject are you asking about?" ❌ (Should remember we're talking about attendance)
```

## Root Cause
- Frontend was only sending the current query to the backend
- Backend had no conversation history tracking
- Each API call was independent with no context

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (`ChatInterface.tsx`)

#### Added Conversation History Tracking
- Now sends the last 6 messages (3 exchanges) to provide context
- Filters out the initial welcome message
- Maintains full conversation state in the component

```typescript
// Send conversation history to maintain context
const conversationHistory = messages
  .filter(msg => msg.role !== 'assistant' || !msg.content.includes('Hello! I\'m your AI campus assistant'))
  .map(msg => ({
    role: msg.role,
    content: msg.content
  }));

// Add current user message
conversationHistory.push({
  role: 'user',
  content: currentInput
});

const response = await apiClient.chat.ask(currentInput, conversationHistory);
```

#### Added "New Chat" Button
- Appears in the header after the first message
- Resets conversation to start fresh
- Clears all previous context

```typescript
const handleNewChat = () => {
  setMessages([
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: 'Hello! I\'m your AI campus assistant...',
      timestamp: new Date(),
    },
  ]);
  setInput('');
};
```

**Visual Location:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 AI Assistant    [+ New Chat] 🟢 Online│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. API Client Changes (`api.ts`)

Updated the chat endpoint to accept optional conversation history:

```typescript
chat: {
  ask: (query: string, conversationHistory?: Array<{role: string, content: string}>) => 
    api.post('/ask', { query, conversation_history: conversationHistory }),
}
```

### 3. Backend Model Changes (`models.py`)

Added `conversation_history` field to the Question model:

```python
class Question(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(..., description="The question to ask the AI assistant")
    conversation_history: Optional[List[dict]] = Field(None, description="Previous conversation messages")
```

### 4. Backend Endpoint Changes (`main.py`)

#### For Authenticated Students:
```python
# Build conversation context if history exists
conversation_context = ""
if question.conversation_history:
    logger.info(f"💬 Conversation history: {len(question.conversation_history)} messages")
    conversation_context = "\n\nPrevious Conversation:\n"
    for msg in question.conversation_history[-6:]:  # Last 6 messages (3 exchanges)
        role = "Student" if msg.get("role") == "user" else "Assistant"
        conversation_context += f"{role}: {msg.get('content', '')}\n"
    conversation_context += "\n"

# Inject student context + conversation history
personalized_query = f"""Student Information:
- Name: {user.full_name}
- Student ID: {user.student_id}
{conversation_context}
Current Question: {question.query}

Instructions: Use the conversation history to understand context and follow-up questions."""
```

#### For Anonymous Users:
Same approach but without student context.

## How It Works Now

### Conversation Flow:

1. **First Message:**
   ```
   User: "What's my attendance?"
   → Sends: { query: "What's my attendance?", conversation_history: [] }
   → AI Response: "Your attendance is 85% (34/40 classes)"
   ```

2. **Follow-up Message:**
   ```
   User: "How many more classes to reach 90%?"
   → Sends: { 
       query: "How many more classes to reach 90%?",
       conversation_history: [
         { role: "user", content: "What's my attendance?" },
         { role: "assistant", content: "Your attendance is 85% (34/40 classes)" }
       ]
     }
   → AI Response: "You need to attend 6 more consecutive classes..." ✅
   ```

3. **Start Fresh:**
   ```
   [User clicks "New Chat" button]
   → Resets to initial welcome message
   → Clears all conversation history
   → Ready for new topic
   ```

## Benefits

✅ **Contextual Understanding**: AI remembers previous messages  
✅ **Natural Follow-ups**: Can ask "what about now?" or "and for next semester?"  
✅ **Better UX**: No need to repeat information  
✅ **Performance**: Only sends last 6 messages (not entire chat history)  
✅ **Fresh Start**: "New Chat" button to reset context  

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Follow-up Questions
1. Ask: "What's my attendance?"
2. Follow-up: "How many more classes to reach 75%?"
3. Verify: AI should calculate based on previous attendance data

### Test Scenario 2: Context Switching
1. Ask about attendance
2. Click "New Chat"
3. Ask about fees
4. Verify: AI doesn't confuse attendance with fees

### Test Scenario 3: Multi-turn Conversation
1. Ask: "What subjects am I taking?"
2. Follow-up: "What's my marks in the first one?"
3. Follow-up: "How can I improve it?"
4. Verify: AI maintains context throughout

## Technical Details

**Message Limit**: Last 6 messages (3 exchanges)  
**Why limit?**: Prevents token overflow, keeps context relevant  
**Storage**: Client-side only (component state)  
**Reset**: Manual via "New Chat" button  
**Backward Compatible**: Works with old API calls (history is optional)  

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ChatInterface.tsx` - Added history tracking & New Chat button
2. ✅ `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Updated API call signature
3. ✅ `backend/models.py` - Added conversation_history field
4. ✅ `backend/main.py` - Process and inject conversation history

## Deployment Notes

- No database changes required
- Backend is backward compatible
- Frontend gracefully handles missing history
- No breaking changes to existing API

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Testing**: Ready for manual testing  
**Breaking Changes**: None
