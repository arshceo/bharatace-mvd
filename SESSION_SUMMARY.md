# Session Summary - All Fixes Applied

## Overview
This session addressed multiple issues related to real-time data fetching, AI chat context, and event queries.

---

## ✅ Fix 1: Fee Status Endpoint - Column Name Mismatch

### Problem
```
Fee card showing incorrect data - full pending amount instead of actual status
```

### Root Cause
Backend was looking for wrong column names:
- Looking for: `paid_amount` and `status`
- Database has: `amount_paid` and `payment_status`

### Solution
**File:** `backend/api/student_routes.py`
```python
# BEFORE
paid = fee_record.get('paid_amount', 0)
status = fee_record.get('status', 'pending')

# AFTER
paid = fee_record.get('amount_paid', 0)
status = fee_record.get('payment_status', 'pending')
```

---

## ✅ Fix 2: Chat Conversation Context Not Working

### Problem
```
User: "What's my attendance?"
AI: "Your attendance is 85%"
User: "How many more to reach 90?"
AI: Talked about CGPA/marks instead of attendance ❌
```

### Root Cause
Backend was building `personalized_query` with conversation history but then passing original `question.query` to AI agent.

### Solution
**File:** `backend/main.py` Line 647
```python
# BEFORE
response = await agent.query(question.query, student_context)

# AFTER
response = await agent.query(personalized_query, student_context)
```

**Also Added:**
- Better conversation context formatting
- Explicit instructions with examples
- Last 6 messages included for context

---

## ✅ Fix 3: Chat UX - Three Improvements

### Issue 3.1: Events Tool Error
**Problem:** AI passing `student_id` to public events function causing error

**Solution:** Updated instructions in `backend/main.py`
```python
4. For student-specific queries (attendance, marks, fees, timetable, library), use student_id
5. For general queries (events, knowledge), DO NOT pass student_id
```

### Issue 3.2: Repetitive Greetings
**Problem:** AI saying "Hey Priya" in every message

**Solution:** Updated `backend/smart_agent.py` synthesis prompt
```python
2. DO NOT start with greetings like "Hey [name]" - get straight to the answer
3. Only use the student's name if it's contextually necessary
```

### Issue 3.3: Annoying Auto-scroll
**Problem:** Chat scrolling when user pressed Enter

**Solution:** `frontend/src/components/dashboard/ChatInterface.tsx`
```typescript
// Only scroll when AI responds, not when user types
useEffect(() => {
  if (messages.length > 0 && !loading) {
    const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];
    if (lastMessage.role === 'assistant') {
      scrollToBottom();
    }
  }
}, [messages, loading]);
```

---

## ✅ Fix 4: Events Tool Timezone Error

### Problem
```
ERROR: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
User: "any events around"
AI: Error retrieving events
```

### Root Cause
Database stores timezone-aware datetimes, code was using timezone-naive `datetime.now()`

### Solution
**File:** `backend/tools/events_tool.py`

Changed all occurrences:
```python
# BEFORE
now = datetime.now()

# AFTER
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
```

**Locations Fixed:**
- `get_upcoming_events()` - Event listing
- `get_event_details()` - Registration deadline
- `register_for_event()` - Registration timestamp
- `get_student_events()` - Event categorization
- `cancel_event_registration()` - Start time checks
- `search_events()` - Upcoming filter

---

## ✅ Fix 5: AI Not Calling Events Tool

### Problem
```
User: "any workshops around"
Logs: Intent Analysis: Find upcoming workshops
       Requires Tools: False  ❌
AI: "I don't have information about workshops..."
```

### Root Cause
AI intent analysis prompt had no examples for events queries, so it didn't know to use tools.

### Solution
**File:** `backend/smart_agent.py`

Added explicit examples:
```python
Public Queries (NO student_id):
- "Any events around?" -> Use get_upcoming_events tool
- "Show me workshops" -> Use get_upcoming_events with event_type="workshop"
- "AI hackathons?" -> Use search_events with query="AI hackathon"
```

**Also Added:**
- Enhanced logging to debug AI decisions
- Better tool documentation in `events_tool.py`

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Conversation Context
- [ ] Ask: "What's my attendance?"
- [ ] Follow-up: "How many more to reach 90?"
- [ ] Verify: AI talks about attendance, not marks

### ✅ New Chat Button
- [ ] Send several messages
- [ ] Click "New Chat" button
- [ ] Ask new question
- [ ] Verify: No confusion with previous topic

### ✅ No Repeated Greetings
- [ ] Ask first question
